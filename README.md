# Movie Recommendation System

Everyone watches movies irrespective of their personalities, and the most interesting fact is that 
each and everyone has their own unique choices in terms of movie preference.
Some people like genre-specific movies be it a thriller, mystery, or sci-fi, while others focus on 
Lead actors and directors.
So, our project which is the Movie Recommendation System can filter the movies and shows 
according to the user’s choice.
A Recommendation System is a filtration System whose main motive is to predict the preference 
of a user towards a domain-specific object which is a movie in our case. It recommends movies 
and shows according to the user’s previous choices.
We have different filtration strategies those are, Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative 
Filtering
